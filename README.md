**Answer:** 
*This is a valuable course for the field, covering essential fundamentals that everyone should know.
 The professor teaches very well, pays attention to students, and puts effort into creating learning materials
 and finding effective ways to help students understand. If I don't understand the lessons, it's probably my own fault since
 I sometimes pay attention and sometimes don't. I thought it was easy, but when I put things off,
 I had to catch up on my own, and it sometimes felt difficult. I encourage those who are interested to submit their work and put effort
 into every assignment given by the professor—it will definitely benefit them in the long run.*
